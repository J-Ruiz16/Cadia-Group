Brief:The program stacks images using a vector class and sequencing between images to stack them.

Design decisions:
-followed the format specified on canvas assignment

Challenges:
-Had difficulty with averaging
-being able to sequence between images.
-adding information to original sequence
-Had trouble reading in files that were in the original ppm. The program can read orion, but not ppms/orion. Don't know if I typed something wrong in the terminal, but sepearate files should work fine.


How work was shared:
-We met up on Monday to assign work for each to do later on compared code to see what we both had and putting it together or adding to what we already had.

Run program:
-ran the program with ./stacker with a simple makefile.
